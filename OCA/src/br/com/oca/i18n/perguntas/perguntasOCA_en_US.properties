exercicio1.questao = Given:\n\nclass Triangle{\npublic int base;\npublic int height;\nprivate static double ANGLE;\npublic static double getAngle();\npublic static void Main(String[] args) {\nSystem.out.println(getAngle());\n}\n}\n\nIdentify the correct statements:
exercicio1.opcao_a = It will not compile because it does not implement setAngle method.
exercicio1.opcao_b = It will not compile because ANGLE cannot be private.
exercicio1.opcao_c = It will not compile because getAngle() has no body.
exercicio1.opcao_d = It will not compile because ANGLE field is not initialized.
exercicio1.opcao_e = It will not compile because of the name of the method Main instead of main.
exercicio2.questao = Which of the following are true about the "default" constructor?.
exercicio2.opcao_a = It is provided by the compiler only if the class does not define any constructor.
exercicio2.opcao_b = It initializes the instance members of the class.
exercicio2.opcao_c = It calls the default 'no-args' constructor of the super class.
exercicio2.opcao_d = It initializes instance as well as class fields of the class.
exercicio2.opcao_e = It is provided by the compiler if the class does not define a 'no- args' constructor.
